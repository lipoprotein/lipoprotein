# About me

I’m @lipoprotein, a simple software developer employed at a software company in the heart of Linz in Austria. Formerly I was studying Computer Science with emphasis on Scientific Computing at the University of Vienna.

## Interests

I'm especially curious about the various kinds of **matrix computation algorithms** I've encountered during my studies, regardless whether they are direct or iterative methods. Currently I try to make myself familiar with **spectral graph theory**, because it is also the connection between matrices and graphs that interests me a lot.

Please don't expect me to be an expert at all those stuff. There is still so much to learn for me in this broad topics. However, don't hesitate if you want to contact me. I'm happy about every message I receive.
